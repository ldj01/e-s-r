This is the INSTALL file for the espa-surface-reflectance package.  This
package uses CMake for managing the build and installation.

This package is dependent on the espa-product-formatter package for shared
libraries.

Following are the command-line steps to perform, assuming the necessary COTS
package environment variables have been set:

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<installation_path>
  make
  make install

The auxiliary tools in lasrc/landsat_aux/scripts and ledaps/ledapsAncSrc
can be installed with

  make lasrc-aux

and

  make ledaps-aux

respectively.
